### Hi there :wave:, I'm Fan.

I'm currently a grad student in ECE working on molecular self-assembly.

- I'm boardly interested in computational physics and theoretical chemistry problems.
- My research trajectoy went from quantum computing experiment, condensed matter theory and nanophtonics to soft matter theory and computation. I have been enjoying the ride and constantly learning new things.   
- I also have a personal interested in how to properly use AI to increase producitivity, both in reseach and in manufacturing settings.
